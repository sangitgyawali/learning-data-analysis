# 📘 NumPy Learning Journey

Welcome to my NumPy learning repository!  
This is part of **Month 2** of my 6-month roadmap to become a **Data Scientist + AI/ML Developer**. In this repo, I've practiced and explored the core functionalities of NumPy — a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

### NumPy Basics
- Installation and setup
- NumPy arrays vs Python lists
- Creating arrays with `array()`, `zeros()`, `ones()`, `arange()`, `linspace()`

### Array Operations
- Indexing, slicing, reshaping
- Broadcasting rules
- Mathematical operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Aggregations: `sum()`, `mean()`, `std()`, `min()`, `max()`, `argmax()`

### Array Manipulations
- Reshape, flatten, transpose
- Stack: `vstack()`, `hstack()`
- Split: `hsplit()`, `vsplit()`

### Useful NumPy Functions
- Random number generation: `random.rand()`, `randint()`, `seed()`
- Logical operations and filtering
- Working with `np.where()`, `np.unique()`, `np.sort()`

## 📌 Why NumPy?

NumPy is the foundation for many other Data Science and ML libraries like **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **TensorFlow**. A strong grip on NumPy helps in faster data processing and manipulation.

## 🚀 What's Next?

Up next in this roadmap:  
**Pandas for Data Analysis** → loading, cleaning, and exploring datasets.  
I'll continue documenting my learning journey and pushing projects here on GitHub.
