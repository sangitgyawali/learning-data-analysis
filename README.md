# 📘 NumPy Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Learning NumPy** repository!  
This repo contains my complete learning process, practice code, and real-world examples with **NumPy**, a powerful Python library for numerical and scientific computing.  
It’s part of **Month 2** in my 6-month roadmap to becoming a **Data Scientist + AI/ML Developer**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

I explored NumPy in **three progressive phases**, from basics to advanced use cases.

---

### **Phase 1 – NumPy Basics**
- Created arrays from Python lists and from scratch using `np.array()`, `zeros()`, `ones()`, `full()`, and `arange()`
- Understood vectors, matrices, and tensors, along with array properties like `shape`, `ndim`, `size`, and `dtype`
- Reshaped arrays, flattened them, transposed data, and explored the difference between `reshape()`, `flatten()`, and `ravel()`
- Compared Python list operations vs NumPy array operations for performance — NumPy was significantly faster

---

### **Phase 2 – Array Operations**
- Learned indexing and slicing with steps, negative indexing, and multi-dimensional access
- Sorted arrays in 1D and 2D (`np.sort()` with `axis`)
- Filtered arrays using boolean masks and `np.where()`
- Compared fancy indexing vs `np.where()` for conditional selection
- Added and removed elements from arrays using `concatenate()` and `delete()`
- Combined arrays with `vstack()` and `hstack()`
- Checked array compatibility using `.shape`

---

### **Phase 3 – Advanced Operations with Business Examples**
- Worked with a restaurant sales dataset for 4 years (2021–2024)
- Calculated yearly totals, minimum, maximum, and average sales for each restaurant
- Computed cumulative sums and visualized results using **Matplotlib**
- Performed vector operations: addition, multiplication, dot product, and angle calculation
- Used `np.vectorize()` to transform string data (restaurant types) into uppercase
- Calculated monthly average sales from yearly totals
- Applied NumPy broadcasting, aggregation, and filtering for realistic business analytics

---

## 📌 Why NumPy?
NumPy is the foundation for many Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **TensorFlow**.  
It offers:
- High-speed computations through optimized C code
- Efficient multidimensional array operations
- Easy integration with the Data Science and Machine Learning ecosystem

Mastering NumPy helps in faster data analysis, better problem-solving, and smooth transitions into more advanced libraries.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Learn **Pandas** for data loading, cleaning, and transformation
- Explore **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- Apply NumPy and Pandas on **real-world datasets** for complete analysis workflows
